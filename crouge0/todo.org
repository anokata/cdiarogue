** menu, start.

* future features

Idea and world First! get old records and generate mechanic
First - fun therefore slash like dia, but not clone dia.
 choise color of your avatar
 Color Elements! sword of red, blue poring, dark green - acid, light green - life
 Collect souls(of colors, grades) to equip, grade up it to cristalize?
 ! TODO Remember ff7-9 dia cata elona poke tohou... etc what elements i like - write down, and which can implemnt
 - materia in equip gain exp and abilitis
 - random encounters, abc time combats
 - capture mobs for link to equip/slots for stats and buffs, resists
 - night mode, time dependent effects
 - bad statuses, blind, confuse, poisoned, sleep, debufs
 - unlimited levels, K M G .. grades of stats, exp, money, souls  or reform
 - mood
 - craft
 - map gen - rooms without coridors hallways - just rooms connected with doors
      make random H or V split space until all rooms squares become less X.  make it walls
      drop Y% rooms
      drop all unaccessible - not has common side
      make doors in common sides (all or % then drop unaccessible)
      - add special zones
 - map gen - rooms grow from one rect on random side other random rect

2. Magic and skill grows like morow
3. World height? it difficult for first try, lets it be simple dung with wild
4. Draw static map, weather zones, caves. Circle
5. fun events, fast grow, new challanges, FF, skills/items (keys, levitate, lava, swim) for access areas, bosses
6. end goal, meaning of all of this - survive and escape from planet. from black entitys.
day part status - sun/moon weather.

* 1. World map, how store, view it with self position. map blocks. view frame.

* What I LEARNED
   Remember fixing mem errors, use valgrind
   make simple structures and basic methods in module
   then other module for more complex, linked to other modules functionality
   then most complex few modules than used by main module?
   More tests, little testing apps.

How make without allocating?

 ATTENTION: Naming convention for func = <modulename>_<obj>_<action>_<opt>
 must be single point of truth SPOT - one description of struct, types, that handle it serialization
* Utils: map editor pipe, fix global map loading
 1. separate map loader using tile_map
 1.1+print loaded to stdout
 1.2 +input map path-name to view
 2. +make map converter from viewable format to string like in data
 2.1 +load by lines from file and out to one line - script : tr -d \n 
 2.2 save converted to map file

* quests types
- reach location
- find(catch) N objects and bring it to npc/location
- escape from
- clear location from x
get quest from random encounter

- traps, and traps with reward

* plot
have a general goal, many rewards and many pitfalls.
Goal: find artifact. what? why? Ring of wisdome. World had stupid. You need cure it.
You hear that artifact deep in cave near forest. You go there and get lost.
... you find artifact and it traped in crystal, you need find magic wand of
freedome, lying in island in see over a desert.

* things to do may separate
- genetic evolve 
- sound
      - play
      - generate noise
      - fade in/out by volume
      - compose in sample
- map gen
- ascii art pic editor mode, terminal again vi keys... + animation.
- UI progress bar with value
- console animation, fake loading with fake hdd sound

Paw of day darkness

* backlog
make dir for src
separate src .c for dirs/modules
fill gcov
m4 proc
calc width or height
